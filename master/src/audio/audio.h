 * The DAC is on this half (GPIO 9/10/11, U8), like everything else the slave
 * cannot reach. So playing a sound is: Linux -> core 1 -> link -> here -> I2S,
 * the same path as the console and the disk.
 *
 * What arrives is 16-bit signed stereo PCM, little-endian, left first -- one
 * frame per 32-bit word, which is exactly what the PIO program shifts out. It
 * lands in a ring here and the DMA completion interrupt drains it. Nothing in
 * this file blocks: the caller is the link service loop, and a loop that waits
 * for a DMA buffer is a loop that is not answering the console.
