 *
 * The PIO program and the ping-pong DMA arrangement come from frank-test's
 * drivers/audio.c, which took them from pico-extras. What is different here is
 * how the buffers are filled.
 *
 * There, the producer calls i2s_dma_write() and it blocks until a DMA buffer
 * comes free -- fine for an emulator whose main loop is the audio loop. Here
 * the producer is the link service, which also carries the console, the disk
 * and the network, and a millisecond spent waiting for a DAC is a millisecond
 * the console is not being served. So the link drops PCM into a ring and
 * leaves; the DMA completion interrupt is what moves it into the buffer the
 * hardware just finished with, and plays silence when the ring runs dry.
 *
 * Taken from frank-linux firmware/master-ioserver/src/audio.c. Resources in
 * frank-amiga: PIO1 (the link is on PIO2, HDMI is HSTX), two dynamically
 * claimed DMA channels, DMA_IRQ_0 (DMA_IRQ_1 is the HSTX scanout's).
 *
 * Board: TDA1387 (U8), DATA GPIO9, BCLK GPIO10, LRCLK GPIO11.
